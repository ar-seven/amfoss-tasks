I came to know how tricky some questions can be, I was learning about python one-liners along with it. I was not able to get sucess for all test cases at 4 questions, I am not good at making good algorithms for now, I am trying to improve it. The task was a good one, really made me understand I have to grind more in this field. Also some testcases were failed due to timeout, I am working on myself to improve at two things: making algorithms and making it efficient.
