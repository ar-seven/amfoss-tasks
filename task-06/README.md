# Ubiquitous UI

I am new  to flutter, I started with the google's tutorial which was very difficult for a starter, then I was all down thinking if i could even do it. Then after setting up the mind I went for the Net Ninja tutorials for flutter beginners. It was a good one. It made me really into flutter. After watching half the tutorial, I started building app. On the first day swipeable screen was done, the next day got some trouble with changing page, finally did it and built the apk.  It took me some time to be back in business, really felt good after finishing the app. I didn't use the introductory screen package though, so I learnt to handle buttons,text gestures,page controllers etc. It was a good task, really enjoyed it. Looking forward for taking a deep dive soon.
