# Aerglo Mars

### It was an interesting task, learned how cli programs work. Also dealing with json files, fetching data from link and downloading image/data from an url.

```bash
usage: aerglo_mars.py [-h] [-id Image ID] [-r Rover name] date

To fetch the mars image based on two parameters - date and id.

positional arguments:
  date           YYYY-MM-DD

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -id Image ID   Image id (on default fetches first image found)
  -r Rover name  Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity(default)
  ```
