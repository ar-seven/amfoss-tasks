# INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?

I prefer smart work over hard work and the reason for this smart work has a more holistic approach to tasks than hard work. Despite yielding results, working hard incurs lots of time and energy while working smartly includes more work in a lesser amount of time. As time is an important tool to be handled in most effective way.

I am dedicated to work in the programming field. I can propose new ideas for projects or to add effective features. 

I am a good leader. I am good at getting together people, spliting work around with people and making a effective plans by looking at the environment to complete a task in most perfect way.

The club will provide me a good environment. I will be able to work with people with same mindsets. I will be having a good circle. And can get connected to seniors for better guidance and advices.

I love to develop to help people.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

As I just started getting to development, I would be exploring all the fields and learn a framework from each category. And after getting a glimpse of all fields, I will choose one and focus more on one category.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
